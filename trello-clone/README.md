Trello Clone
This is a Trello-like board application built using Next.js and React, allowing users to manage tasks by adding, editing, deleting, and rearranging task cards within multiple lists.

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
Node.js (Latest LTS recommended)
Git

Clone the Project:
To get a copy of the project, run the following command:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Trello_Project_.git

Navigate to Project Directory
cd Trello_Project_/trello-clone

Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install required dependencies:
npm install

Run the Development Server
Start the application in development mode:
npm run dev

If you face issues running the command, try:
npx next dev

The application should now be accessible at:
http://localhost:3000

Build for Production
To create an optimized production build, run:
npm run build

After building, start the production server with:
npm start

Troubleshooting
If npm run dev fails with a missing next error, reinstall dependencies:
npm install
Ensure no other processes are using port 3000.
If ESLint errors occur during build, review the errors and fix them in the code.
